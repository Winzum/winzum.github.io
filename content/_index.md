## Pleased to meet you!

{{< profilepic >}}

My name is Lennart van Winzum, {{< currentage >}} years old, Linguist and Tech-enthousiast. I've always liked trying different things to acquire knowledge that was placed outside my comfort zone, which led to my broad and interdisciplinary curriculum. I'm particulary interested in the overlap between communication and technology.

I'm learning more about software development, data analysis and user experience.

In my free time I like to do different sports (cycling/running/swimming), I will read a book or play the guitar.
